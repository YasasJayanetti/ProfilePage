		<h2 style="color:Navy;"><u>Biography</u></h2>
		<P><b>
		I was born in Sri Lanka. It is an island in indian ocean. I grew up in central part of Sri Lanka. 
		I lived with my parents and life was simple. In my school days my favourite subject to study was Information and Communication Technology. 
		Because of that I have an interest to learn further into this subject. After I graduating from my high school I enrolled to 
		an university to follow a four years of bachelor's degree programme in Information Technology. The most important thing that I 
		learned in there was we cannot master at least one particular area in this subject without an up-to-dating everyday in this high paced technological era. 
		In that case, after completing my bachelor's degree I decided to study further and do a master's degree in this field. So I enrolled to The 
		Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics in Japan for do my master's degree.
